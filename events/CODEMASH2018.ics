DESCRIPTION:Many project teams use Slack as a means of communication with one another. Why not also use it to communicate with your infrastructure? Invite a helper into your conversation that can perform routine tasks tirelessly, conversationally, and interactively.\n\nIn this 4 hour workshop, you will build a Slack bot that understands natural language and integrates with your DevOps pipeline. You will use the Slack Events API to receive messages, and the Slack Web API to send them. You will use LUIS to interpret language and extract intent. You will execute actions against the Visual Studio Team Services Web API in response to user requests, and subscribe to Webhooks to notify your team of important events. In the end, you will have a new member of your team who can help you with your build and release pipeline.\n\nWorkshop outline\:\n\nSlack API\n* 	Authorization - OAuth and API key verification\n* 	Events API - respond to posts\n* 	Web API - post messages\n* 	Identify users and channels\nLUIS\n* 	Specify intents and entities\n* 	Train your app\n* 	Evaluate utterances\n* 	Call LUIS from your Slack bot\nVSTS\n* 	Web API - interrogate source repository and build status\n* 	Webhooks - respond to checkins and build completions\n* 	Call services asynchronously to keep the conversation going\n* 	Respond to the requester when events happen\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7740

DESCRIPTION:You've done a "build your first mobile app" precompiler, or maybe some online tutorials. You've connected to an API and made something appear on a screen, even! It's time to move beyond that and dig a little deeper. In this precompiler, we'll explore two bigger topics in iOS development, one foundational and one flashy. Protocol-oriented programming is a fundamental paradigm in Swift development and powerful way to extend functionality without the complications of inheritance. ARKit, announced at WWDC 2017, provides a platform for stunning new augmented reality experiences. We'll combine the two into a fun "The Floor Is Lava" game that will level up your Swift skills and provide a solid foundation for exploring iOS development even further.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6971

SUMMARY:Devour the Cloud with Locust Swarms - Hands on Load Testing

DTSTART:20180109T130000Z
DTEND:20180109T170000Z
DESCRIPTION:Your website works great with a handful of users.  What happens when there are 10k or 100k concurrent users?  Where are the performance bottlenecks?  How do you scale it?  Before you can do that, you have to be able to consistently apply a simulated user “load” to the site, and measure the performance.  In this session you will start with a functional Python Django web app running in AWS along with some vaguely defined load targets.  From there we'll walk through establishing a user interaction model and implementing it in locust.io, a Python-based distributed load testing tool. That user model will be used to load the web app under test, establish baselines and pick some metrics and interactions to target. We'll then experiment with a few common scaling techniques to demonstrate quantitative improvements.  You’ll gain practical, hands-on experience with load testing concepts and methods.\n\nLanguages\: Python\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7567

SUMMARY:Effective Gherkin: Quality Requirements for the Enterprise

DTSTART:20180109T130000Z
DTEND:20180109T170000Z
DESCRIPTION:Developing software is costly. It is made more costly by miscommunication. Developers and Testers make mistakes because they misunderstand the business requirements. Business analysts make mistakes because they misunderstand the stakeholders. The result are defects that typically go unnoticed until the software has been implemented, which leads to expensive and time-consuming rework. Quality requirements are the nexus of understanding for stakeholders, designers, developers, testers, and customers. In this workshop, you will learn how to develop a set of quality requirement standards to reduce the cost of quality and meet the customer’s needs. The training will leverage the industry practice of Behavior Driven Development, which promote requirements by example & collaboration, to develop a shared language across not only a team but the whole enterprise. The shared language is written in Gherkin format (Given, When, and Then specifications) to define requirements independent of application type and focused on delivering value that everyone in the organization understands.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7017

SUMMARY:Getting Real without Getting Fired -- Saying Things in a Way People Can Hear
DTSTAMP:20180104T003600Z
DTSTART:20180109T130000Z
DTEND:20180109T170000Z
DESCRIPTION:Are important words often left unsaid at your place of work? Do you feel like you're navigating a complex maze in conversations? Does your message tend to miss the mark with co-workers, who increasingly seem to be impediments to reaching your goals? Are these unspeakable truths in your workplace that you wish someone would resolve for you?\n\nTrust and communication issues within the workplace can hollow out an organization. Invisible lines get drawn. Alternate forms of communication open up to subvert perceived rivals. Allies are recruited, reinforcing an us vs. them behavior cycle. Organizations are suffering from a lack of trust, and it's costing them speed, productivity, and collaboration. What can YOU do about it?\n\nRegardless of your title, you can be a leader in your organization, and a leader's first job is to inspire trust. In this session, Allison and Marcus will share models to evaluate your own behaviors and facilitate activities to help you find your voice for speaking the truth in a way that builds trust. Softening the truth can feel comfortable in low trust environments--it's simpler, nicer, and can make you look like a team player. It can also lead to miscommunication, undelivered news, and blame shifting. On the other hand, saying the truth in all of its ugliness is risky and potentially career-limiting. Finding the sweet spot of communication to become a trusted leader takes self-awareness and practice. Attend this workshop and learn to recognize how your behavior is building trust--or not--and practice speaking hard truths so that others can hear it.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7354

DESCRIPTION:After a brief overview where we explain what the teams will do, we will be dividing into 3 teams.  A CAD team, a SLICER team, and a 3D printer team.  The teams will try to manually replicate with the team each piece of the 3D object development and replication process!  The CAD team will model the shape on graph paper. The Slicer team will figure out how to build the model and convert it to numbered “human gcode” instructions on 3X5 cards and the 3Dprinter team will try to execute those instructions on a grid representing a printer bed with a 3D doodler hand held extrusion pen! We’ll start by doing 2D shapes and as the teams get going we’ll try to make a basic 3D shape! This session hopes to explain how the process works at a basic level. This is an experiment involving discovery and teamwork and is probably most appropriate for children with basic measurement and writing skills although we will try to accommodate children that are not disruptive of any age.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7886

We will explain the XYZ coordinate system, and what the different views are for. We will also spend some time playing with the transform functions.  This session is best for kids with basic skills in measurement, elementary level geometry, and basic computer skills.  Probably most appropriate for children over 8 but all are welcome based on your child’s capabilities and ability to enjoy. The goal of the session will be creating 3 basic things, – a cup, a keychain, and a toy house.\n\nWe will be doing this on the big screen and those at CAD stations or their own PC are welcome to follow along and make their own versions! (software requires PC/MAC, there is no Chromebook version, but we should have lab PC’s this year) We will encourage teaming up kids on PC’s so less confident or younger kids are welcome to pair up and just watch, but can still collaborate.  Kids that complete all three kid projects without issue are welcome in the adult walkthrough lab as they will be making more slightly advanced models that are different.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\: A kids lab will follow morning sessions where kids can possibly print items or make others. There is also open lab in the late afternoon. We will be able to produce screen renders of all models kids would like to, and can print possibly one model per kid depending on demand.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7894

DESCRIPTION:Neural Networks. Deep Learning. TensorFlow. What are these buzzwords? What is the latest Artificial Intelligence craze? This advanced session contains cutting-edge information *not* easily found online, and does *not* require a PhD in Machine Learning to understand. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can be used to generate text that will look like its original training data. There are many [articles](http\://lewisandquark.tumblr.com/tagged/neural+networks) out there that show hilarious end-results of such adventures, but start-from-scratch walkthroughs that show the raw code, like this one, are hard to come by. This presentation will demonstrate what you need to join in, grab your own data set, process it, train it, and sample it. Training the data on a CPU can take hours, but in this session you can learn how training on a GPU with hardware acceleration takes only seconds. Come away from this session with your own datasets to “randomly” generate new bodies of text!\n\nHands-On attendees will find and pull their own dataset, pre-process it, sample, and train it. If time permits, we will explore GPUs on Azure.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6942

It was started in 2010 by JetBrains, the company behind Intellij Idea and Android Studio, and has grown exponentially over the last few years.  It's recently gained first class support for Spring and Gradle, and is used in the products of big companies like Pinterest, Evernote, Atlassian, and Netflix.  And, if you had any doubts of whether Kotlin was here to stay, Google announced Kotlin as an official language for Android at Google I/O 2017!\n\nJoin us for an in depth, interactive introduction to the language.\nWe'll cover\n* Basic syntax\n* Nullability\n* Object-oriented programming with Kotlin\n* Functional programming with Kotlin\n* Java interoperability\n* Building DSLs\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7199

DESCRIPTION:As a leader, be it as a manager, team lead, or individual contributor, how do you know which leadership style is best? And how are decisions best made on the team?\n\n\nWhen, if ever, is command and control appropriate or even a “best practice”? What about collaborative consensus building? Should a single expert make the call or should the team agree on everything?\n\n\nThe answer is probably somewhere in the middle.\n\n\nIn this half-day workshop, you’ll explore the complexity of work and examine how it maps to leadership and decision making. You’ll learn when command and control is actually best versus when collaboration is most effective. Finally, Doc and Diane will teach you tools to improve your collaboration efforts.\n\n\nReturn to the office a more aware leader, prepared to help your team have the highest impact through your effective leadership and decision making.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7651

DESCRIPTION:## Take your CSS skills to new heights with today’s techniques.\n\nIt’s no joke that things in the web move fast. A few years ago, staying on the forefront of CSS was knowing the vendor prefixes for the latest CSS3 implementations and poking around at Sass or LESS. Now, in addition to the preprocessors, we have postprocessors, build systems, and CSS components—not to mention the latest and future CSS features! In this workshop, we’ll help get you up to speed on these various approaches to writing CSS, their advantages, and how you can start using them. Whether you're a regular CSS practitioner ready to level up or a backend dev expanding your skillset, we’ll cover all you need to organize, manage, and write modern CSS.\n\n### We’ll cover many of the new tools, practices, and techniques prevalent in CSS today.\n* Naming conventions (BEM, SMACSS, etc.)\n* CSS processors (Sass, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, etc.)\n* Build tools\n* Mixins and Functions and Plugins\n* New CSS features and how to use them (plus previews of CSS4 features)\n* Tips and tricks to common CSS problems\n\n### What to bring\:\n* A practical knowledge of CSS—we’ll be diving into some advanced areas in this workshop.\n* A CodePen.io account (they’re free!)—we’ll be putting several concepts in practice, utilizing CodePen in some cases.\n* Optionally, we have examples of more advanced tools—in which case, it would be helpful to have Node.JS installed beforehand.\n* And a computer, of course!\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7737

DESCRIPTION:So you can sling some code and automate a web browser, and even work on a team that has a fair bit of UI automation around your "favorite" web application.  No doubt you have found yourself spending to much time fixing an inconsistent suite of tests. You might even be asking yourself "are these tests even worth it?". (the answer is yes!)\n\nLets explore where things typically break down in the acceptance testing process. Starting with breaking  user stories into acceptance criteria, and how the words the team chooses can affect the software that is built. Then taking a deep dive into best patterns and practices in automating the scenarios with cucumber and other ruby modules.\nAlong the way answering questions such as how should I manage my test data? Should I ever delete tests?  And, how do I keep my test pyramid from becoming a test cupcake?\n\nAttendees will walk away from this session armed with information to help them write better acceptance criteria, and tips to keep their test suites clean and less brittle.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7661

DESCRIPTION:This session will tour the maker lab, and talk about the exciting world of 3D printing with a bit of the history of the technology. We will look at the lab’s printers as well as models made on them. We’ll then cover choosing a CAD app and will briefly cover using curated 3D printer object libraries and different CAD apps that might be more appropriate to different types of projects. We will also cover different types of 3d printers as well as advantages and disadvantages of 3d printing services. After this session you’ll have the starting point on how to make models, where to get them if the model already exists, and where to print them.  We will finish the hour with a basic walk through of the process of planning a model, a very quick view of Rhino3d, how to convert to a stereolithography file (don’t worry, we will explain what that is!) and slice and finally print on a 3D printer. If you have heard of the exciting world of CAD and 3D printing but have never tried it or would like a basic overview this lab is for you!\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7868

We will focus in on the process of using CAD to create our model with a NURBS modeler called Rhino3D and will walk through and create up to three basic models\: a goblet, a challenge coin, and a spaceship model. We will also look at some completed models that were created for 3d printing and discuss what one should consider when making a successful printable model.\n\nWe will discuss scaling, splitting, tolerances and other final model steps in Rhino3D, as well as converting to a stereo lithography file the slicer program (Cura) can read. We’ll discuss the various settings in CURA and how to set up the G-CODE file that the printer will use.\n\nHigh School aged teens or late junior high aged students may also attend adult sessions. Additionally, kids that complete all three kid projects in the morning sessions without issue are welcome in this lab as well as we will be making more slightly advanced models that are different.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7871

DESCRIPTION:In this workshop, we’ll start by exploring two functional\nprogramming languages that these days are relegated largely to\nacademic study, highlighting the influences they’ve had on modern functional programming paradigms and reinforcing these ideas by recreating the abstractions that set the groundwork for functional programming as we know it today. First, we’ll cover ML, a language whose ideology remains largely unchanged for over 40 years and considered the common ancestor of modern functional languages like Haskell, OCaml and F#. Next, we’ll cover Racket, a LISP derived from Scheme which shares similarities and probably inspiration with a number of currently popular languages, perhaps most obviously, Clojure and perhaps less obviously, Javascript. Lastly, we’re back to where you work\: I’ll present exercises that help to reinforce the ideas\nlearned from ML and Racket to be solved either in the language of your choosing, or Javascript (the de facto language of examples and\nsolutions du jour).\n\nJoin me for an enlightening foray into some languages largely\nforgotten or ignored by the industry that are certain to help you\nbring new ideas about functional programming to your daily practice,\nwhatever it may be.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7374

DESCRIPTION:This workshop will teach participants some of the basics of improvisation and ideas on how it can be used in at work. There are studies that suggest improv does help us all to become better team members, learners, innovators, and communicators. Companies are using the improv methods as a way of creating more innovative and collaborative teams, for brain storming, and creating a work environment that says “Yes” before “No”. Improv training can help students become better learners and make learning more enjoyable. Come and learn about improv and why companies such as IDEO, Google, Marriott, and Twitter have embraced this to build a culture that promotes better communication, collaboration, and team building. This workshop is an interactive workshop. Please attend and have fun learning how to be more positive, vulnerable, attentive, and playful in your daily grind.\n\nUpon completion of this course, attendees will be able to\n1. Identify areas where improv can be used in their work.\n2. Perform some basis improv components.\n3. Use improv games as tool to innovate and ideate.\n4. Understand how failure fits into life-long learning.\n5. Exemplify the “Yes And” mantra in their work.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6808

DESCRIPTION:The way we feel is important!\n\nAll that we think, do, or say is influenced, to some degree, by emotions. Many successful businesses and people recognize the importance of emotional considerations.\n\nThe way we feel is important and should be considered!\n\nAll software is intended to help solve some problem, and both problems and solutions evoke emotions. Software requirements are simply wants or needs, which often stem from core emotions. Research shows that emotions can affect the acceptance or rejection of software. \n\nThe way we feel about software is important and should be considered!\n\nA placebo is designed and used primarily to evoke emotions. Things like sugar pills, false elevator door close buttons, and fake office thermostats aim “to please”, rather than have any other physical effects. Placebo requirements focus on emotions. And so, considering software through the lens of a placebo can help emphasize emotional considerations, and provide a valuable perspective on bugs, ethical design, and much more.\n\nIn this workshop, I support the claims above, suggest some methods to elicit and test emotional requirements, and finally, use placebos as a lens to view software design and testing. Using presentations, demonstrations, and interactive discussions and exercises, we collaboratively explore why “The way we feel about software is important and should be considered!”\n\nWorkshop Takeaways\:\n* Practical methods to get and measure emotional requirements \n* A different and deeper understanding of emotions and requirements\n* An introduction to the fascinating and spooky world of placebos\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6817

DESCRIPTION:Penetration testing is just QA testing, with a different focus. Where QA is about making sure your app actually does what it should do, reliably and smoothly, pentesting is about making sure your app doesn't also let people do other things - things they shouldn't be allowed to do, like steal your database - and that when it has to fail, it fails cleanly and safely. The tools are similar, and the objective is similar, but the mindset is a little different.\n\nIn this precompiler, you will spin up a VM you can keep, with some webapps you can test, and tools you can use to test them. You'll learn how to use these free tools to find some vulnerabilities, and - more importantly - understand why they happen. What you learn will make you a more versatile and confident developer or tester, and just might chop a couple of pages off your next pentest report.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7348

DESCRIPTION:After a brief overview where we explain what the teams will do, we will be dividing into 3 teams.  A CAD team, a SLICER team, and a 3D printer team.  The teams will try to manually replicate with the team each piece of the 3D object development and replication process!  The CAD team will model the shape on graph paper. The Slicer team will figure out how to build the model and convert it to numbered “human gcode” instructions on 3X5 cards and the 3Dprinter team will try to execute those instructions on a grid representing a printer bed with a 3D doodler hand held extrusion pen! We’ll start by doing 2D shapes and as the teams get going we’ll try to make a basic 3D shape! This session hopes to explain how the process works at a basic level. This is an experiment involving discovery and teamwork and is probably most appropriate for children with basic measurement and writing skills although we will try to accommodate children that are not disruptive of any age.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7885

DESCRIPTION:This second hour session we will attempt to walk the attendees through the process of building a basic model from geometric shapes. We will explain the XYZ coordinate system, and what the different views are for. We will also spend some time playing with the transform functions.  This session is best for kids with basic skills in measurement, elementary level geometry, and basic computer skills.  Probably most appropriate for children over 8 but all are welcome based on your child’s capabilities and ability to enjoy. The goal of the session will be creating 3 basic things, – a cup, a keychain, and a toy house.\n\nWe will be doing this on the big screen and those at CAD stations or their own PC are welcome to follow along and make their own versions! (software requires PC/MAC, there is no Chromebook version, but we should have lab PC’s this year) We will encourage teaming up kids on PC’s so less confident or younger kids are welcome to pair up and just watch, but can still collaborate.  Kids that complete all three kid projects without issue are welcome in the adult walkthrough lab as they will be making more slightly advanced models that are different.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\: A kids lab will follow morning sessions where kids can possibly print items or make others. There is also open lab in the late afternoon. We will be able to produce screen renders of all models kids would like to, and can print possibly one model per kid depending on demand.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7893

DESCRIPTION:Does your program send data over the network? When debugging, it is useful to know what data your program is sending and receiving. This presentation will explain basic networking, how to use WIreshark to see the data and how to use Wireshark Generic Descriptor to define custom protocols.\n\nIf your program sends data over the network, then you may someday need to know what it looks like on the network. When debugging, it is often useful to know exactly what data your program is sending and receiving. This presentation will give you a quick refresher (or fast introduction) to basic networking protocols, explain how to use WIreshark to see your data and how to use Wireshark Generic Descriptor to define you custom protocols.\n\n**Networking Refresher** A review of basic networking, standard protocols (IP, TCP, UDP, etc.) and how the networking model uses this layers to build messages.\n\n**Wireshark Overview and Demo** After an overview of how to use Wireshark, we will look at some of example data captures to practice using Wireshark, as a group and also in individual excercises.  We will also have examples and excercises to illustrate the lessons learned in the Networking Refresher.\n\n**Wireshark Generic Descriptor (WSGD)** If you have a custom protocol, you will need to define it so that Wireshark can display the data.  We will look at the three options for creating dissectors.  We will look at how to define a protocol using WSGD and how to configure Wireshark to use it.  We will look at examples of Wireshark displaying data in custom protocols and have excerses in creating disectors to display packets from an example custom protocol.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7830

DESCRIPTION:What do Facebook, Google, Netflix, LinkedIn, WordPress and Etsy all have in common?  They are all well known IT organizations that practice continuous delivery and deployment (CDD).  This helps them reduce the risk associated with releasing code, improve system resiliency, and reduce overall software development costs.  At any point and often multiple times per day, they deploy the latest changes to their production environment with full confidence because their builds have been tested automatically. \n\nIn this hands on session, you will learn how to continously deliver with confidence. You will set up a development pipeline for a sample application. Step by step, you will assemble individual tasks and link them together to form a pipeline that takes a code change from source control all the way to a live production environment.  But a pipeline is just the start.  Along the way you will learn how you can use feature toggles, fast failures, small changes, and optimized tests to encourage a culture of CDD right now.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6928

DESCRIPTION:You've read all about Elixer, Haskell, Clojure, etc. and are really excited by functional programming.  But in your day job, you are a Java programmer.  Can functional concepts be applied in a language like Java that is not a purely functional language?  The answer is a resounding "yes"!  If you will embrace functional concepts in your every day work, then your code will be cleaner, smaller, and easier to maintain.\n\nIn this pre-compiler, we will embark on a successive refinement exercise to refactor a horrible deeply nested looping monstrosity into something more elegant and functional.  Along the way, we'll learn about the features in Java that are moving Java into the modern functional world including\:\n\n- Streams\n- Map, Filter, Reduce\n- Optionals\n\nThe code exercises for this session will be in Java, but the concepts are equally applicable for JavaScript and C#.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7418

DESCRIPTION:Ever see a cobweb and wonder how the spider can create something so complex? Similar to that cobweb, embedded systems and the associated software are growing in complexity. Advancements in hardware are pushing the boundaries of software development techniques. \n\n\nThe development of autonomous vehicles is challenged with system integration and validation techniques. Traditional product development starts from a physical hardware point of view and then adds software. As hardware complexity increases, companies must drive product development with software. Companies with software at their core are able to accomplish speed to market faster than the spider can spin its web. This is done by driving development with modern software practices such as test driven development and continuous integration.\n\n\nExperience an interactive workshop on how to develop an embedded system while using modern software practices. \n\n\nLearn how to\:\n- Test drive an embedded component.\n- Mock an unavailable component.\n- Apply Test Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration (CI) and Mocking to achieve a scalable software process on an embedded project.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7240

DESCRIPTION:This session will tour the maker lab, and talk about the exciting world of 3D printing with a bit of the history of the technology. We will look at the lab’s printers as well as models made on them. We’ll then cover choosing a CAD app and will briefly cover using curated 3D printer object libraries and different CAD apps that might be more appropriate to different types of projects. We will also cover different types of 3d printers as well as advantages and disadvantages of 3d printing services. After this session you’ll have the starting point on how to make models, where to get them if the model already exists, and where to print them.  We will finish the hour with a basic walk through of the process of planning a model, a very quick view of Rhino3d, how to convert to a stereolithography file (don’t worry, we will explain what that is!) and slice and finally print on a 3D printer.

DESCRIPTION:Accessibility is often an afterthought when developing apps of any kind, yet if your app is not embracing accessibility, you are losing a large percentage of your potential market. In addition to lost market share, there is a legal aspect of accessibility, especially if you build applications for government organizations. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act mandates specific types of accessibility features in your app, and the rules for apps are different than the rules for web sites, so we'll learn what rules apply to mobile apps. Every app can benefit from applying these rules even if the government is not involved. This session demonstrates hardware and software tools and coding techniques which enable inclusivity in your Android app and embrace disabled users.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7267

DESCRIPTION:Lock-in is a misunderstood concept. Most of the time it's associated willy-nilly with vendors. Open Source is considered a panacea resolving the lock-in issue once and for all. In extreme cases some believe if they write everything from scratch the problem never surfaces. Unfortunately the opposite is true.\n\nLock-in is when you choose a bespoke solution, including one you create, and the cost of change exceeds your budget. It’s not about vendors. It's not about Open Source. It's about making careful decisions about the cost of change.\n\nSoftware is best designed by making explicit decisions when options are presented. The CAP theorem is a great example\: choose consistency of data or availability of date in the face of a network partition. If you don't make an explicit choice when components can't speak to each other a choice will be made for you.\n\nLikewise, when selecting components for your architecture the possibility of lock-in always there. Sometimes the organization gains more from making future change more costly by accepting lock-in. In that way lock-in may not be so bad! Often, though, lock-in represents too great a risk. It's important to evaluate these tradeoffs carefully.\n\nIn this talk I'll describe the thought exercises I've used in making architectural decisions around lock-in. You'll learn how to thing strategically about the implications of building, buying, or using a component in your architecture. These techniques make software design and planning run more smoothly and help you eliminate biases of tribalism and fashion from the process.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7747

DESCRIPTION:Are you using or moving to AWS? Have you considered how you organize and secure your AWS environments? The growing push to cloud providers has allowed us to move faster and tackle problems more efficiently. The same freedoms that have allowed us to move faster have also created scenarios where security issues are exposed by accident and/or without proper management and review. As companies move toward more and more cloud usage, teams are pushed harder to ensure the same compliance and security requirements that exist in slower moving private environments. This has the potential to put us right back where we came from.\n\nJoin Aaron as he talks through the most critical security decisions you can make for you AWS environments. He will identify issues and solutions in an automation friendly fashion that aim to fit seamlessly into the development and deployment lifecycle. This session will cover the following topics\:\n\nAccount provisioning and IAM\nCredential management\nVPC setup and network design\nAWS services that boost your security posture\nAuditing AWS configurations to find security holes\nCreating a robust CI pipeline that ensures no obvious security holes are present within your environments\nIn addition to these topics a heavy emphasis on both platform and server automation will be included. Please note that this session is heavily tuned to people using Amazon Web Services. If you are using another Cloud provider the ideas will still be relevant, but not all solutions will be available for your provider.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7589

SUMMARY:Crimson and Clover, Over and Over (and Over). Applying a Framework to Continuous Security

DTEND:20180111T140000Z
DESCRIPTION:Tommy James wrote “Crimson and Clover” while attempting to change the band’s sound and shift their focus from releasing singles to releasing entire albums. Continuous Security (or SecDevOps, AppSecDevOps, DevSecOps, Rugged Devops or whatever else you want to call it) is in need of a “Crimson and Clover.” \n\nMost organizations are still overwhelmingly focused on the security of single applications. Those moving to continuous delivery models either ignore security completely or discover that security becomes a bottleneck in their quest to deliver an album…I mean code…rapidly. \n\nIn this session, we will share how you can create our own “Crimson and Clover” in the form of a Security in DevOps Framework. You can use a framework to allow organizations to establish a baseline of their environment and use it to make informed decisions when trying to fill the security gaps in their continuous delivery pipeline. The a security in DevOps framework offers a benchmark for continuous security improvements while also demonstrating not only that security is important, but that it can be achieved while hitting your DevOps targets. That’s a win-win for everyone involved. \nIn this talk, we’ll discuss\:\n•	A structured approach to solving the complicated problem of integrating continuous delivery and application security.\n•	How you can apply a framework to your continuous security model and inform your strategic decisions.\n•	How to collect evidence and metrics to provide application security guidance at speed and scale.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7054

DTEND:20180111T140000Z
DESCRIPTION:If your mobile app stores data locally, you’ve probably at least looked at SQLite or Core Data . These come with their share of pain points.  Database schema changes are inevitable with changing requirements and require tedious data migration. Working with SQLite often requires a clumsy mix of SQL with Swift/ObjC/Java/Kotlin and it’s very easy to go wrong. And then, there is the potential impedance mismatch issue to consider while trying to model data as relational tables. \n\nThis talk will examine NoSQL as an alternative to locally persisting data on mobile platforms. We will provide an overview of the various flavors of NoSQL, focusing on the  Document model. While NoSQL database technologies is gaining traction in large scale distributed applications, we will discuss it’s benefits as an embedded database on mobile platforms for enabling both offline-first and offline-only use cases.\n\nThen I will introduce Couchbase Lite, an open source, cross-platform NoSQL embedded data store for your mobile apps. We will compare and contrast it with existing solutions. We will discuss how you can integrate this in your mobile apps and walk through examples describing the CRUD and Query interface. \n \nAt the end of the talk, you will walk away with a good idea of the benefits of NoSQL as a embedded store with Couchbase Mobile as a concrete example. Anyone building a mobile app with local storage needs will benefit from this talk.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6937

DESCRIPTION:Artificial Neural Networks are a fascinating computational approach modeled to react similar to a biological brain to solve problems.  Neural networks are a very powerful tool that enable machines to teach and evolve themselves.  You can utilize this power in almost any application.  Don’t be intimidated by the equations and Greek symbols of this cutting-edge technology, I will guide you on how to slay this technology and make it bend to your will.  \n \nIn this session, we are going to demystify the apparent Neural Networks complexity without the need of mathematical background providing an approachable overview. There will be very little math and lots of coding. The goal is for everyone to become acquainted with Neural Network from a pragmatic standpoint.\n \nJust when you think it couldn’t get any better, I will show you how to employ the functional paradigm to leverage multicore machines and GPUs to make your neural networks predictions infinitely faster through parallelism. \n \nBy the end of this talk, you will learn the basic concepts of Neural Network and how to apply functional concurrency to estimate future stock prices at blazing fast speeds…and perhaps get rich while practicing.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7049

How do you know that everything is fine after you roll out a new deployment? Or... How do you start diagnosing an incident in production in the middle of the night? \n\n\nWouldn't be nice to have a tool that allows you to see how real traffic flows within your microservices and external dependencies?\n\n\nThis talk will have a live demo that goes through all the steps  to use Hystrix in a JVM-based app and expose those metrics via Turbine for Vizceral. \n\n\nVizceral is a tool from Netflix to visualize traffic between components. This data needs to be fed from somewhere however. Hystrix provides fault tolerance, and a nice stream of all metrics. Turbine aggregates the hystrix streams per cluster.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6786

Do you write code that ‘works’ or code that is crafted so perfectly it will never show a flaw? We will explore timeless principles that make great code\: recognizing code smells, writing for testability, keeping things simple and clear. Many of these ideas were written down decades ago, but are still ignored. The most important first step is viewing code as a craft, something that is done for its own sake rather than something hacked out to solve a problem. In this session, you’ll learn how to create a plan for steady improvements. Syntax, languages, frameworks all fade away. A mindset that is focused on craft will never fail.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7223

The teams will try to manually replicate with the team each piece of the 3D object development and replication process!  The CAD team will model the shape on graph paper. The Slicer team will figure out how to build the model and convert it to numbered “human gcode” instructions on 3X5 cards and the 3Dprinter team will try to execute those instructions on a grid representing a printer bed with a 3D doodler hand held extrusion pen! We’ll start by doing 2D shapes and as the teams get going we’ll try to make a basic 3D shape! This session hopes to explain how the process works at a basic level. This is an experiment involving discovery and teamwork and is probably most appropriate for children with basic measurement and writing skills although we will try to accommodate children that are not disruptive of any age.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7884

It had been 15 years since the last significant update to JavaScript, and the front-end world (as we knew it) changed. It has been over a year now and the excitement has ebbed, but our productivity is in flow. We’ve gotten past the novelty of the new features and learned how to use them effectively in everyday code.\n\nThese 10 insane tips will help you understand when and where to use these new features (including ES2016 and ES2017 features) of JavaScript. We’ll touch on effective use cases of modules, destructuring, template strings, arrow functions, generators, and much more. Using real-world examples, you’ll see how to leverage the new language capabilities for maximum readability and expression. If you haven’t jumped into ES201x, we’ll discuss how to embrace the future while preserving browser compatibility. If you have used it, see how others are using it.

DESCRIPTION:Handoffs create waste\; heavy handoffs create heavy waste. The way developers and testers collaborate can make the difference between a team that works as a cohesive unit, and a team that works against itself. As a developer, do you find yourself trying to understand bug reports about code you committed weeks ago? As a tester, do you worry that submitting a bug creates unplanned work, threatening the project's timeline? Over time, heavy handoffs can create a gradual accumulation of project risk, an ever-growing backlog of bugs, and, in the worst cases, an adversarial relationship between developers and testers.\n\nIn this experience report, software tester Clint Hoagland will discuss how TechSmith's Camtasia team moved off a heavy process where dev tasks languished in a "Ready for Testing" column for days or even weeks before being tested, and moved instead to a process using exploratory testing artifacts inside GitHub Pull Requests. This process revitalization enabled developers and testers to work comfortably together\: reducing risk, minimizing rework, and keeping quality high as a sustainable practice. Clint will discuss where the team started, how it's working now, as well as specific techniques and recommendations the team found along the way.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7086

Unfortunately Android makes it far too easy to make a big, tightly-coupled mud pie out of these activities (pun intended). This makes implementing new features, testing, and maintaining existing code a nightmare.  \n\nSo how do you build a complex Android app without coupling everything together? \n\nEnter EventBus and MVP.  In this session we'll describe how to build and test a flexible, maintainable app using the Publisher/Subscriber and Model-View-Presenter patterns to cleanly separate our concerns.  Developers who attend this session will leave with new tools and techniques to separate the view from the business logic, and to cleanly implement network calls and error handling.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7685

In this session attendees will learn the basics of deep learning in an approachable and friendly way. The session will start from problem inception to actually training and improving a deep learning model. Attendees should come away with a game plan on how to incorporate these techniques in their existing software projects. I make jokes too.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6914

DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wished that there was an automated way to alert you that you left the garage door open? Or create a cool digital badge to wear at Codemash? Or create a small robot with your kids? Anyone can create projects like these but getting started can sometimes seem overwhelming if you have no experience with hardware/sensor integration. \n\nIn this session, I will introduce a variety of low cost, introductory projects and platforms that you can do at home that cross over between robotics and IoT. Many of which are child friendly so you can do them with your family. Then we will deep dive into two projects I have created\; a sensor to alert me to open doors and a digital badge. We will go over the platforms, tools and techniques to create each of these at home. By the end of the session you should feel that you have the resources and knowledge to begin to create some of these project at home.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7275

DESCRIPTION:The two primary contributors to poor quality in an organization are lack of involvement by management and lack of knowledge about quality. Without the right processes and people, quality will be either a cost center or forgotten component by development. To achieve organizational success, enterprise quality must take action to build quality from the top down. Management must accept responsibility for the quality practice within the organization and promote it across the organization. Everyone is responsible for quality, not just QA. The journey is fraught with obstacles -- maturing the quality practice of an organization builds long-term success with robust processes and well-trained employees.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7667

DESCRIPTION:This second hour session we will attempt to walk the attendees through the process of building a basic model from geometric shapes. We will explain the XYZ coordinate system, and what the different views are for. We will also spend some time playing with the transform functions.  This session is best for kids with basic skills in measurement, elementary level geometry, and basic computer skills.  Probably most appropriate for children over 8 but all are welcome based on your child’s capabilities and ability to enjoy. The goal of the session will be creating 3 basic things, – a cup, a keychain, and a toy house.\n\nWe will be doing this on the big screen and those at CAD stations or their own PC are welcome to follow along and make their own versions! (software requires PC/MAC, there is no Chromebook version, but we should have lab PC’s this year) We will encourage teaming up kids on PC’s so less confident or younger kids are welcome to pair up and just watch, but can still collaborate.  Kids that complete all three kid projects without issue are welcome in the adult walkthrough lab as they will be making more slightly advanced models that are different.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\: A kids lab will follow morning sessions where kids can possibly print items or make others. There is also open lab in the late afternoon. We will be able to produce screen renders of all models kids would like to, and can print possibly one model per kid depending on demand.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7892

This talk will go a step beyond the answer, and look at what we can learn about languages by comparing how they solve our common problems. What does a language’s built-in-functions tell us about why they were created and how they are best used? Let’s find out.

DESCRIPTION:When it comes to app security, scanning is good, but pen testing is better. That said, we're lucky if we can schedule (and budget for) a web app pen test once a year. Wouldn't it be swell if we could automate the security testing process so it turned up the same weaknesses in QA an attacker would likely try to exploit in Prod?\n\nWell, then. You're in luck.\n\nOWASP's Offensive Web Testing Framework (OWTF) was designed to help automate the web app pen testing process. By baking the OWTF into your own QA processes, you can benefit from the same knowledge and tools that the bad guys use to attack web apps. Better yet, you can run these tests as frequently as you like for FREE.\n\nThis presentation will show you how to use the OWTF, helping you improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of your app security testing process.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7177

DESCRIPTION:CSS is hard. It’s a simple language, but getting it right and avoiding specificity hell can be a challenge if you don’t have the right framework to back you up.  Especially in large scaling projects, you might start adding ID selectors here and !important properties there and the next thing you know you’ve backed yourself into a corner where even the smallest of UI changes will take hours to work out. Ew.\n\nOr how about this? Ever jump into a project and find that even the slightest markup change results in broken JavaScript AND sometimes even broken backend feature tests?! WTF. Ew.\n\nThis talk will look at how taking a modular, object-oriented approach to CSS can turn frontend woes into frontend wins. We’ll examine modern CSS approaches like OOCSS, SMACSS, and BEM and demonstrate how they will help to not only decouple your CSS styles and reduce specificity conflicts, but how they will also help to decouple your CSS and HTML from your JavaScript and feature specs.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6771

We’ll overview the normal roadblocks that people typically run in to, and practical coding strategies to overcome those road blocks on your way to embracing a Test Driven Development lifestyle - make coding without tests as uncomfortable as coding naked! - From the author of Automated Unit Tests chapter in the Wrox Book “Real World .NET, C# and Silverlight - Indispensable Experience from 15 MVPs, we will learn\: \n* Distinguish between the 4 major elements of automated unit tests. Code, Tests, Testing Framework and Test Runners and how they interact with each other to round out your engineering practices.\n* Discover how Mocking Frameworks and DI make your tests easier to read and write in everyday life.\n* Dig in to better ways to write and organize your tests so that they communicate intent, document your code for you and bridge the gap between development and business needs.\n* We’ll take a more specific look at those “hard to reach” places like the edges of your code, extension methods and other interesting scenarios\n \n\n* Note everyone will leave their cloths on - it’s not that kind of talk!\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6858

DESCRIPTION:It seems like there are two types of developers - those who have encountered a hacked together custom OAuth implementation, and those who have never used OAuth. The simplicity of the protocol encourages redevelopment where none is needed, which creates avoidable design and security headaches. This session is designed around providing a strong base in building an OAuth application, exploring what questions to ask and which strategies to use. Attendees will also see a few real world examples, both good and bad, of implementing OAuth with both custom and out of the box solutions.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7534

DTSTART:20180111T164500Z
DTEND:20180111T174500Z
DESCRIPTION:Concurrent programming is in! Delegating work to many running processes at once can increase most programs' performance and scalability. Many languages have libraries or frameworks that provide tools for writing concurrent code, but far fewer bake concurrency right into the language. The Go programming language not only does, but also provides synchronization across processes when needed through messaging. Go's channels and goroutines provide powerful, scalable, and convenient concurrency without having to download countless third-party packages. These features of the language make concurrent Go programs enjoyable to write and doubly efficient--both in developer time and actual program execution. In this session, attendees will discover the advantages of using Go through the creation of a simple, concurrent web service, and will walk away ready to harness the power of goroutines for fun, productive coding and performant programs.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7619

DESCRIPTION:Unless systems you build are developed with concurrency in mind, they probably do not take full advantage of modern multi-core CPUs. Concurrent programming facilitates the use of multiple processors, but is difficult to implement using traditional approaches. Fortunately, new approaches taken by functional languages have begun to address these difficulties. \n\nIn this highly interactive session, volunteers from the audience will help present the basics of concurrent programming concepts, how these concepts have been addressed historically, and how functional languages such as Erlang, Clojure, and Haskell address these concepts today. With this knowledge you will begin to think about software architecture differently, and may even decide to introduce concurrency into your next project.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7554

You know the data you want is in there, but digging it out of the built-in data table UI feels like the "doing it the hard way" part of an infomercial.  \n\nNow, imagine being able to shape your data the way that makes it easiest to understand and debug, limited only by your imagination (and time, of course).\n\nIn this session, we'll take a look at the Visual Studio Debugger Visualizer feature, available in all version of Visual Studio (even the free one!) that lets you create your own graphical display of your .NET data structures while debugging. Shape the data the way you want to make it easier to digest -- hide unimportant info, quickly expose deeply nested elements, compare large object graphs, or even instantly search Stack Overflow for help with an Exception.  Display it in whatever way is best for your data and your understanding of it, act on the data and even modify the it from your custom view. We'll talk through the options available to you, some of the limitations, and security risks/considerations involved.\n\nThis session doesn't require much deep knowledge of .NET, but the examples will primarily be in C#, WinForms and WPF.  You don't need to know any of those beyond what you can Google or find on Stack Overflow, though the results will be useful to novices and well-weathered developers alike.

DESCRIPTION:This session will tour the maker lab, and talk about the exciting world of 3D printing with a bit of the history of the technology. We will look at the lab’s printers as well as models made on them. We’ll then cover choosing a CAD app and will briefly cover using curated 3D printer object libraries and different CAD apps that might be more appropriate to different types of projects. We will also cover different types of 3d printers as well as advantages and disadvantages of 3d printing services. After this session you’ll have the starting point on how to make models, where to get them if the model already exists, and where to print them.  We will finish the hour with a basic walk through of the process of planning a model, a very quick view of Rhino3d, how to convert to a stereolithography file (don’t worry, we will explain what that is!) and slice and finally print on a 3D printer. If you have heard of the exciting world of CAD and 3D printing but have never tried it or would like a basic overview this lab is for you!\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7870

DESCRIPTION:This lab is intended to be a fast-paced technology walk-through of the process of creating a 3D printed object.  We will focus in on the process of using CAD to create our model with a NURBS modeler called Rhino3D and will walk through and create up to three basic models\: a goblet, a challenge coin, and a spaceship model. We will also look at some completed models that were created for 3d printing and discuss what one should consider when making a successful printable model.\n\nWe will discuss scaling, splitting, tolerances and other final model steps in Rhino3D, as well as converting to a stereo lithography file the slicer program (Cura) can read. We’ll discuss the various settings in CURA and how to set up the G-CODE file that the printer will use.\n\nHigh School aged teens or late junior high aged students may also attend adult sessions. Additionally, kids that complete all three kid projects in the morning sessions without issue are welcome in this lab as well as we will be making more slightly advanced models that are different.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7873

DTEND:20180111T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:(Presented by Gunnar Ostergren)\n\nWhile developers differ in their selection of tools and coding language of choice, many face the same challenges that are hindering productivity. Often times, developers have to use multiple systems to manage their source code and project artifacts. Couple that with the highly distributed nature of today’s work environment, and it’s no wonder why development teams lack visibility and a holistic view of the entire software development lifecycle. This can be problematic, especially in light of increasingly shorter turnaround times for bringing products to market. \n\nCode hosting and collaboration platforms, on the other hand, solve those challenges. During the presentation, Chuck Gehman, technical marketing engineer at Perforce, will talk about why these platforms are needed for today’s developers and how they create a consolidated environment that allows developers to be autonomous, and as a result, more productive. \n\nSpecifically, Gehman will delve into the following benefits of code hosting platforms\:\n•	Self-Service\: Rather than waiting on IT, project managers can fulfill their own requests through fine-grained permissions and delegated user management with the LDAP/AD system.\n•	Developer Flexibility\: Modern platforms are now accommodating multi-repos and repository types (e.g., Git, Subversion, Maven, etc.) in one project. This is allowing development teams to exploit all of their development resources while maintaining a single source of truth.\n•	Automation\: Code hosting platforms automate processes (e.g., build notifications, repo creation) to the greatest extent possible, enabling developers to focus on developing the actual software.\n•	Seamless Collaboration\: Code hosting platforms streamline code reviews with merge request code reviews and flexible developer workflows. What’s more, users can set permission on feature branch workflows so approvals are required to merge changes. \n•	Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery\: Rather than isolating development from downstream processes, code hosting platforms synchronize with the continuous integration server and development tool chain (e.g., Jira, Slack, Jenkins) for continuous delivery.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7860

However, real life requirements demonstrate a time and place for both flavors of data persistence, and often a mix of the two. Regardless of your chosen development platform, the careful composition of more than one type of database can dramatically simplify your application and better handle larger workloads.\n \n Objectives\:\n \n * Know when to use relational data, and when not to. Fight the urge to normalize everything.\n * The secret sauce to scale is often precalculation. Aggregate querying is a huge pinch point for many LOB applications.\n * Documents can hold a ton of serialized data that can be formatted and served to users. You might be surprised to find that relational databases are pretty good for this as well.\n * Cloud resources open up a world of possibility, where storage is cheap.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6931

DESCRIPTION:In times where a jungle of JavaScript frameworks wants to solve every conceivable problem in web app development, creating headaches and javascript fatigue in the process, Elm offers a different approach.\n\nElm is a functional programming language that you can use instead of JavaScript — or alongside it. It builds on the concepts virtual dom and unidirectional data flow popularized by React and Redux, but with a sound typesystem, built-in immutability, and an amazing compiler that catches errors before you even run your code. Simply put, Elm is a great language that will make your backend team jealous (unless they're already on the very similar F#).\n\nIn this talk you'll see how Elm works and learn how to use it to build a web app. I will emphasize the advantages and disadvantages it brings compared to the traditional JavaScript tech stack used at my most recent project.\n\nThis talk is not aimed at experienced functional programmers coming from languages such as Haskell, but rather JavaScript developers seeking a more functional approach in their daily work. It serves both as a introduction to Elm and typed, ML-style functional programming.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7844

DESCRIPTION:Have you been hearing a lot about Kotlin recently? Well, there’s good reason. Created in 2010 by JetBrains, Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that was built with a focus on being safe, approachable, and pragmatic. Over the last few years, it has seen a dramatic rise in popularity due to first class support in Spring, Gradle and, most recently, Android. Used by companies like Pinterest, Evernote, Atlassian, and Netflix -- Kotlin looks like it’s here to stay.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll take a quick tour of the Kotlin syntax, what makes it so powerful, and set you on your way toward coding bliss.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7597

DTEND:20180111T213000Z
DESCRIPTION:Are your controller actions gigantic? Is your service layer bloated? Are testing and maintenance a nightmare?  Need a scalable solution?\n\nThe CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) development pattern can help address these issues. But implementing a distributed CQRS architecture can be intimidating. If not well designed, it can make your application exponentially more complex and difficult to maintain.\n\nSo why not start simple?\n\nUsing the popular .NET library, MediatR, it’s super easy to write simple, testable, scalable CQRS applications.\n\nIn this session, we will explore CQRS and its core concepts while building a mind-blowingly simple ASP.NET Core application with MediatR. We will emphasize separation of concerns, dependency injection, code reuse, thin controllers, and unit testability.  You will leave with knowledge and confidence to start using MediatR in your own projects.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7136

DESCRIPTION:Visualizing big data already comes with the innate challenge of packaging overwhelming mountains of data into a human-digestible format.  The browser adds an extra level of challenge in limits on how many DOM elements can effectively render, limitations of HTML canvas, and the quirks of JavaScript.  Understanding these limits is a great start to making the most of the browser.\n\nAttendees will learn about\:\n* The pros and cons of canvas, SVG, and non-SVG elements when it comes to interactivity and volume of data.\n* When to use a library, and which library (low-level like D3 or high-level like Highcharts)\n* When to roll your own visualization (no library)\n* Pitfalls and tips of integrating into a framework (like React)\n* Designing new non-standard elements to meet new use cases (with a real life case study in visualizing Spark apps)\n* Workarounds for when there's too much information to fit on the page\n\nExpect to leave armed with information and tips on making useful, approachable big data visualizations in those little browser windows.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6788

DTSTART:20180111T203000Z
DTEND:20180111T213000Z
DESCRIPTION:Machine learning is beginning to have a major impact on software development for all platforms and industries. However a life of developing software in a traditional explicit manner is not the best training for developing machine learning algorithms. Software developers faced with problems like "What is in this image", "Is image a face and is it smiling?", or "Is this a hot dog?" would face much difficulty without a machine learning algorithm approach.\n\nThis session explains what a neural network is in simple terms. That definition is expanded to include Convolutional Neural Networks and why they are great for image recognition. A sample neural network implemented in Keras and trained with the MNIST dataset will be demostrated to recognize handwritten digits. This session will conclude with an sample iOS application using CoreML to run the neural network directly on a phone and recognize digits in real time.\n\nYou will leave this session with some ideas on how to begin to approach problems best solved with machine learning algorithms.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6823

DESCRIPTION:As NoSQL databases increase in popularity, they also increase in popularity with hackers. NoSQL databases are vulnerable to traditional attacks like SQL injection (yes, really). Further, the rush to productivity leaves some of these databases insecure-by-design. As a result, ransom notes have plagued databases like MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Hadoop, and CouchDB. This session demonstrates security mistakes and prevention. We'll also look at what NoSQL vendors are doing to mitigate future attacks.

DTSTART:20180111T203000Z
DTEND:20180111T213000Z
DESCRIPTION:Policy-based authorization allows developers to implement rules-based authorization that extends far beyond role validation. This pattern is an important part of an approach called **Risk Adaptive Access Control (RADAC)**. One RADAC strategy that is enabled by policy-based authorization is leveraging machine learning to authorize actions based on behavior patterns as well as environmental factors. This allows developers to implement non-functional security features such as recognizing when critical data is being scraped by a script or a user manipulating data in a suspicious manner. In this session, we will review the concepts behind RADAC, and show real-world scenarios where it can be applied using Azure Machine Learning and policy-based authorization in ASP.Net Core MVC.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7234

DESCRIPTION:Don’t get me wrong, testing on the rack is important, but shouldn’t be your only strategy… or your starting point.   In this talk we will discuss effective ways of testing embedded software and hardware utilizing modern software practices, minimizing errors, testing time and budget.\n \nDefects are expensive and undetected defects can be devastating.  The earlier a defect can be identified and eliminated, the cheaper the cost.  If a developer can find issues while writing unit-tests, the developer can easily fix the issue because they have all of the information available.  Integration testing provides the next level of protection… detecting specification and architectural problems.  \n\nTesting your hardware shouldn’t be any different than testing your software.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7734

DESCRIPTION:The real world, with all its complexity, can at the same time be simple, elegant and beautiful. It thrives on autonomy and asynchrony, the two most important things that bring order to chaos. The real world does not pause for something to complete before moving on. And yet, when we write software, “Command and Control” is the norm. We find clever ways of doing this while keeping up with all the new technologies and the languages in fashion, all the while ignoring the realities of life.\n\nIn this session, explore an alternate universe in which Event Driven Architecture can power even the most complex mission-critical systems. Learn how communicating asynchronously via events leads to building systems that are autonomous and much more reliable. Embrace asynchrony and autonomy.

DESCRIPTION:Scala is arguably the de facto language of choice for the big data world but with a dauntingly steep learning curve. This session will immediately dispel that concern by exposing the minimal syntactic differences between Java and Scala. Participants will then learn how to use Scala for writing cleaner, more readable code. Once you've seen how easy the switch can be, you'll get hooked by its expressive features. Expression-based coding can return a value directly from an if statement and pattern matching can create clear, type checked code paths. This and more allows you to write less boilerplate and more maintainable, business code. You'll leave this session with enough of the basics to be able to make the switch. But be warned, once you go Scala it's hard to go back.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7712

DESCRIPTION:Threat modeling is a way of thinking about what could go wrong and how to prevent it. Instinctively, we all think this way in regards to our own personal security and safety. When it comes to building software, some software shops either skip the important step of threat modeling in secure software design or they have tried threat modeling before but haven't quite figured out how to connect the threat models to real world software development and its priorities. \n\nIn this session, you will learn practical strategies in using threat modeling in secure software architecture design and how to apply risk management in dealing with the threats.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7184

DESCRIPTION:Congratulations! You're building a sweet new web application with React. But what are you doing for unit testing?\n\nSetting your environment up for JavaScript unit testing can be intimidating. React tooling is phenomenal, though, and makes setup a breeze. In this session, we'll look at how to get started writing tests for your React app. We'll dig into the features of Jest as a test-runner and test framework. Then we'll take a look at Enzyme, a framework for testing your React components directly. Finally, we'll look at guidance and best practices. What should you test? When should you test it? How can you keep your React code friendly to unit tests?\n\nYou will leave this session ready to cover your React app with tests.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7099

DESCRIPTION:After a brief overview where we explain what the teams will do, we will be dividing into 3 teams.  A CAD team, a SLICER team, and a 3D printer team.  The teams will try to manually replicate with the team each piece of the 3D object development and replication process!  The CAD team will model the shape on graph paper. The Slicer team will figure out how to build the model and convert it to numbered “human gcode” instructions on 3X5 cards and the 3Dprinter team will try to execute those instructions on a grid representing a printer bed with a 3D doodler hand held extrusion pen! We’ll start by doing 2D shapes and as the teams get going we’ll try to make a basic 3D shape! This session hopes to explain how the process works at a basic level. This is an experiment involving discovery and teamwork and is probably most appropriate for children with basic measurement and writing skills although we will try to accommodate children that are not disruptive of any age.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7883

If you build systems that communicate on the same machine or the same local area network, then you probably don't feel the pain, but the moment you start distributing your systems across multiple data centers that pesky speed of light limit starts to rear its head.\n\nIn this talk I'll teach you how to laugh in the face of physics, building systems that give you the performance you need, spanning across the globe. Using real-world lessons learned from building and operating DNSimple, I'll show you how to decide what tradeoffs you have to make to meet the needs of your customers, developers, and operators. By the time we're done, you'll have a better understanding of design techniques that you can use to make your systems perform well, even if they are spread across the planet.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6854

We will explore how we can use Elm's type system to make the compiler do much of the thinking for us, and how by putting some thought into how we model our data we can end up with code that is easier to read, understand and maintain. I will also share my experiences from being a frontend tech lead and talk about why it is important to focus on developer happiness.\n\nAlso, did you know that the compiler can output a JSON file with documentation for your code? This is pretty cool, and I will show you how we can use this to create living documentation with code examples and even show previews of your view functions!\n\nIf you are new to Elm you will leave this session with a deeper understanding of why developers using Elm really like it, and if you have used Elm before you will hopefully learn some new tricks to apply to your own projects.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7845

Terraform provides a powerful declarative programming language and runtime model tailored specifically toward the deployment and management of cloud resources. With Terraform, developers are able to quickly add or modify servers in the network, add new load balancers and DNS records, and, because it’s all in code, they could even rebuild the whole network from scratch on a moments notice.\n\nThis talk introduces several patterns for working with Terraform. You'll leave this talk prepared to provision servers with configuration management systems like Ansible or Chef, to modularize your infrastructure deploys, to maximize uptime through rolling deploys, and to effectively use Terraform in a team setting. This talk assumes some basic knowledge of cloud infrastructure.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7686

DESCRIPTION:REST is dead!  Long live GraphQL!  (Just kidding… this isn’t a zero-sum game). As the proliferation of clients emerge (Android, IOS, Web, etc), we are learning that REST does have some limitations, and you’ve probably seen them first-hand.  GraphQL, by FaceBook, is an attempt to fix the limitations of REST by allowing the client to specify the data it needs via a single endpoint. Servers can expose any data from any source via a typed interface, and clients can gain the freedom to ask for exactly the data they need without over-fetching. In this session we will discuss the limitations of REST, the power of GraphQL, and some implementations. We’ll discuss some best practices, and the tooling that has emerged in this space to make your developer experience top-notch.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7108

DESCRIPTION:So you’re interested in security. Maybe you’re looking to get into the field. Maybe you understand the importance of security and want to improve in that area. Most developers want to get security right, but where do you start? This talk will provide actionable advice on embedding security into your current process. I will show you the resources, tools, and activities at your disposal. This will make your application more secure and also more efficient. Security vulnerabilities are ultimately just bugs in an application. Catching issues early saves time and money. \n\nWe’ll talk about what I see developers are doing right. I’ll share the difference between dynamic and static analyzers and where to use them in your process. We’ll talk about tools such as the Zed Attack Proxy, Fiddler, and useful plugins. We’ll also get into activities that will improve security and the process. Activities like Code review, threat modeling, and patching. I’ll highlight the available resources to developers. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a big resource for developers. We’ll also dive into some of the leaders in the application security field. The last few years I’ve had the opportunity to work with development teams and help them embed security into their process. This talk is based on those experiences. Allow me to show you what the wonderful world of security and how to embed it in your process.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7029

DESCRIPTION:Microsoft Azure can be used for container deployment in a variety of ways including support for Orchestrators like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm and Mesos. However, the abstraction for app development that support application self-healing, scaling and so on may not be at the right level. Helm and Draft makes this a lot easier.\n\nIn this primarily demo-driven session, we will cover Kubernetes deployments on Azure with some simple examples. We will look at Helm and Draft and how they can simplify app development significantly, like app. Scaling, rollback, etc. Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications, like the apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes. Draft works with pre-provided charts to deploy the apps. via Helm.\n\nAfter attending this session, attendees will be able to walk away with a thorough understanding of Draft and Helm and how they can use these tools for deploying apps into Kubernetes clusters.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6735

DESCRIPTION:Unit testing has become an accepted part of our lives as .NET programmers. To help focus our tests to only the code we want to validate, Mocking Frameworks are a powerful tool in our toolbox. Like many tools, if you have an understanding of how the tool works under the hood, you can bend it to your will (and also know where it’ll break if you bend too much).\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn about the two main types of mocking frameworks\: constrained frameworks (like RhinoMocks and Moq) and unconstrained frameworks (such as Typemock Isolator and Telerik JustMock). I’ll dig into how the two actually do their magic and we’ll discuss the pros, cons, and limits of both. We’ll look at examples of how to use the frameworks in your tests, mocking out dependencies from your own code and even third-party logic.\n\nYou’ll get the most out of this session if you’re comfortable reading C# code and have a general understanding of class inheritance in .NET, along with some experience writing and running unit tests. Prior experience using mocking frameworks is not necessary.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6750

DESCRIPTION:Electron gets a bad rap for being a slow and resource-hungry wrapper around Chrome, but in reality, it's a very capable desktop application framework that's well-suited for building complex software. Leveraging the capabilities of Node.js, you can read and write files, work with databases, speak bespoke IP protocols to control connected devices, and then wrap it all up behind a responsive, quick, and friendly user interface.\n\nIn this session, we'll explore a successful Electron application that does all of those things. You'll learn about Electron's general architecture and how it works to make all these things happen. You'll hear about how the team of React, Redux and TypeScript all worked together to make this complex application robust and understandable. We'll talk about lessons learned while building this application, including how some realizations and subsequent refactors simplified it and made it faster and easier to implement new features. We'll cover what was done when performance problems reared their ugly heads so the application could easily handle a hundred state updates per second, smoothly updating metrics and plotting devices' positions on live maps. We'll also talk about what the stack's limitations are, so you know what Electron is good at, helping you to leverage its strengths and avoid its weaknesses.\n\nIf you've been wondering whether Electron is right for your project, this tour through the development of a complex and successful application will help give you the information you need to make a well-informed decision and get you started using Electron to build it.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7287

DESCRIPTION:As a child, did you ever play with walkie talkies? Do you remember how fun it was to talk with friends and family from the other end of the house, or across the neighborhood?\n\nCapture that feeling again, except this time learn some science behind it and how to use the same technology to contact someone on the other side of the country with just a radio and some wire.  This session is an introduction to amateur radio aimed toward IT professionals. Accordingly, the focus will be on how to get licensed, and introducing the more technology focused aspects such as digital communication modes, antenna design, and commonly used software.\n\nWhile amateur radio cannot be used for commerce, many lessons learned in the hobby are almost directly applicable to everyday work and you will walk away with a better understanding of wireless technology.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6755

DESCRIPTION:This second hour session we will attempt to walk the attendees through the process of building a basic model from geometric shapes. We will explain the XYZ coordinate system, and what the different views are for. We will also spend some time playing with the transform functions.  This session is best for kids with basic skills in measurement, elementary level geometry, and basic computer skills.  Probably most appropriate for children over 8 but all are welcome based on your child’s capabilities and ability to enjoy. The goal of the session will be creating 3 basic things, – a cup, a keychain, and a toy house.\n\nWe will be doing this on the big screen and those at CAD stations or their own PC are welcome to follow along and make their own versions! (software requires PC/MAC, there is no Chromebook version, but we should have lab PC’s this year) We will encourage teaming up kids on PC’s so less confident or younger kids are welcome to pair up and just watch, but can still collaborate.  Kids that complete all three kid projects without issue are welcome in the adult walkthrough lab as they will be making more slightly advanced models that are different.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\: A kids lab will follow morning sessions where kids can possibly print items or make others. There is also open lab in the late afternoon. We will be able to produce screen renders of all models kids would like to, and can print possibly one model per kid depending on demand.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7891

Even with advancements like insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring, the process is still manual and error prone. What if someone with T1D could delegate the constant cycle of monitoring, predicting and controlling to a computer in their pocket?\n\nIn this session, you'll learn about an open source project called the Open Artificial Pancreas System, or OpenAPS, and how it closes the loop on a cycle that the rest of us take for granted. Then we'll explore  how Elixir and the Nerves project are being used to build a next generation artificial pancreas system.\n\nWe'll touch briefly on the topics of hardware prototyping, reverse engineering and decoding binary data and how it all came together in one project. Before the session is over, you'll see an embedded Elixir application talk to a commercial insulin pump using off the shelf hardware.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6796

DESCRIPTION:If you have been developing .NET applications within the past 15 years, you have traditionally been supporting only Windows. Because, of course, the .NET Framework was designed to only run on Windows.\n\nIf you were adventurous, you could attempt to run your application on Linux or Mac using the Mono compiler. However, some inconsistencies in the implementation of common libraries meant you had to target one environment or another -- never both.\n\nWith the release of .NET Core, the prophecy of being able to build true cross-platform applications using .NET is coming true! However, it isn't as easy as File, New. Design decisions you make can impact your ability to easy work across platforms. In this presentation, attendees will learn how to create cross platform .NET Core applications and how to avoid the pitfalls that will land them back into Windows-only mode.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7250

DTEND:20180112T170000Z
DESCRIPTION:The rendering wars have begun! Front-end templating frameworks like React, Angular, and Ember have all generally settled on a similar component-based paradigm, but they're still differentiated by their vastly different rendering engines. This talk will dive deep into React's rendering engine, codenamed Fiber, and Ember's rendering engine, Glimmer. Both engines have recently revealed brand-new and rewritten implementations aimed at optimizing for performance. Fiber attempts to do as much work as possible between each frame to make sure the browser is always free to paint the page. Glimmer takes a totally different approach\; it pre-compiles templates into a bytecode that is then interpreted by a "virtual machine" in order to perform the most optimzed updates possible. After we dig deep into the code behind the actual implementation of each engine, attendees to this talk will walk away with an in-depth understanding contemporary renderers along with some knowledge about what factors to consider when trying to choose a framework.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7753

DESCRIPTION:Everyone has been there at least once\; part of a team or group that has become so dysfunctional there seems to be no way to move forward. This type of behavior often leads to deep frustration and despair, as people in these kinds of environments seem to only respond to negative and often dramatic communication. However, this type of dysfunction is not usually the fault of any one person or group of people on the team but is the result of the team's inability to recognize and deal with a needed change in a positive and healthy way. In this interactive discussion, you will use the latest in behavioral change modeling to learn how to identify the stages of change. You will come to understand and leverage the decisional balance shifts at each stage. You will discover ways to help people move forward in modifying unwanted behaviors in a healthy way. And, most importantly, you will find out how to support people in maintaining those behavior changes into the future. This session will give you the tools you need to help move a team from dysfunctional to functional without having to remove a single head.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7580

DESCRIPTION:Machine learning enables us to make future predictions based on patterns learned from historical data.  If we apply these principles to a large body of text, we can predict what the next word or character in a document will be and generate writing in a similar style.  This will help us solve a major #firstworldproblem\: let's build our own George R.R. Martin to generate GoT scripts (yes, I know, he didn't write the TV scripts).  In this session, I will teach the basics of neural networks, the different types, and where each excels.  Then I will demonstrate how to generate text using machine learning by training a model on the scripts of the "Game of Thrones" television series, and having it output new text in the same style of writing.  You will walk away with an enhanced understanding of machine learning and neural networks, and maybe even some predictions for season 8!\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7684

DESCRIPTION:Automated browser tests can be a nightmare to write and maintain. Unlike unit tests they’re tough to set up, slow to run, make permanent changes to data in the system, and they’re incredibly brittle. Even a tiny CSS change can result in cascading failures!\n\nYou can’t *totally* avoid these issues, but you CAN manage them by adopting a few key patterns and techniques. This session explores the lessons learned by one product team as they moved from manual regression testing to an automated process using Canopy and Selenium. You’ll go beyond the basics of single-page testing and see real-world suggestions for managing test data, executing complex and multi-page tests, organizing and writing test code, and coping with “permutation explosion”. You’ll also learn techniques for involving the entire cross-functional team in the process.\n\nThis session is designed for developers and architects that know how to automate the browser, but are struggling to leverage that knowledge into a suite of maintainable UI tests that provide acceptable ROI. It focuses on patterns and principles, not a specific automation technology.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7749

DESCRIPTION:The greenfield project started out so promising. Instead of devolving into big ball of mud, the team decided to apply domain-driven design principles. Ubiquitous language, proper boundaries, encapsulation, it all made sense.\n\nBut along the way, something went completely and utterly wrong. It started with arguments on the proper way of implementing aggregates and entities. Arguments began over project and folder structure. Someone read a blog post that repositories are evil, and ORMs the devil incarnate. Another read that relational databases are last century, we need to store everything as a stream of events. Then came the actor model and frameworks that sounded like someone clearing their throat. Instead of a nice, clean architecture, the team chased the next new approach without ever actually shipping anything.\n\nBeyond the endless technical arguments it causes, domain-driven design can actually produce great software. We have to look past the hype into the true value of DDD, what it can bring to our organizations and how it can enable us to build quality systems. With the advent of microservices, DDD is more important than ever - but only if we can get to the good parts.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7081

With so much data available and so many different views of data required, there has to be a way to satisfy the demand.  Event driven systems coupled with actor models can be a way to solve this problem.  In this session, we'll walk through how to solve the sports scenario described earlier using an event driven architecture and an actor model to process the data.  Some tools and libraries we'll look at include Akka.NET, Elm, and RethinkDB.  After this session, you'll have an appreciation of event driven architecture, how actor models can help with these architectures, and how you can start building one today.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7339

LINQ and Entity Framework are both commonly used in the .Net ecosystem, but even well-written applications can have LINQ queries that are difficult to understand. Because LINQ is so flexible, it can be written in ways that fail to communicate the developer’s intent. Well-written LINQ should be so clear as to be self-documenting. To write clear LINQ, it helps to understand the details of a few LINQ components that improve LINQ’s readability.\n\nWe’ll be showing how to use a pipe and filter pattern to make LINQ queries easier to comprehend. We will take a deep dive into expression trees to understand how they work, and how to manipulate them for maximum re-usability.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7072

DESCRIPTION:Are you interested in writing compilers, targeting Web Assembly, finding security issues automatically, binary analysis, or understanding performance at a low level? While it’s always good to know how your language works, the benefits of understanding the intermediate language extend to metaprogramming and analysis across multiple source languages. Learning how to work with intermediate languages allows you to write programs which would seem unattainable otherwise. You will learn not only how IL works but how it compares with LLVM IR, Java Bytecode, and other intermediate representations. No mere “deep dive,” you’ll leave this talk really understanding how C# turns into microcode and how to use that information to do “impossible” things.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7383

Furthermore, browsers are protecting us from more-and-more attacks, but what are all of these acronyms? SOP, CSP, XSS, HSTS, HPKP, CAA... at the end of the day, we just want useable AND secure applications. This talk will break down exactly what all of these acronyms and browser-enforced security policies mean. Attendees will learn implementation and long-term strategies in effort to increase security posture without potentially sinkholing your user's traffic. Whether you're a first time developer, multi-linguist application guru, or simply an app user who wants to know what all of this security fuss is about - this session will appeal to the entire security conscious gamut.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7007

DESCRIPTION:Subtitle\: Increased Productivity on APIs for the Whole Team\n\nAbstract\: RESTful APIs are becoming ubiquitous in today’s digital world.  The Programmable Web now boasts over 18K APIs in it’s directory and the pace of publishing is accelerating.  Every organization will need to provide or use REST APIs.  Whether your team is a backend resource or API provider, client app development team, or you live in between these two as a proxy, you would benefit from a robust test framework.  This session opens with a brief overview of the API landscape and unfolds the evolution of a test framework.  Developed initially for API proxy developers, who needed simple, scripted, headless REST call and validation while maintaining client state\; its execution model expanded for improved decoupling of API calls and asserts, API independence from client/provider, and dev/run perspectives.  The concepts presented are applicable whether you choose to ‘roll your own’ solution or extend an existing REST testing client like Postman.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7682

DESCRIPTION:In object-oriented languages like Ruby, people often say that “everything is an object”—but first-class *functions* have become standard for object-oriented languages too. C# has had them and other related features for years, and even Java is in the game these days! Some “functional” languages seem to have some very object-oriented-looking features, too. If that sounds wrong to you, let's talk about polymorphism and more in languages like Clojure, Elixir, and even Haskell! So where does object-oriented programming (OOP) end and functional programming (FP) begin?\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn to look at these programming paradigms with a more critical eye, focusing on where FP and OOP folks fundamentally disagree, where these paradigms have more in common than the industry's rhetoric suggests, and how you can use those insights to make better decisions about the software you build.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7687

And as such, any mobile app that deals with data needs to work reliably in all environments\; from a WiFi connection with a high throughput Internet connection, to an intermittent cell connection that keeps dropping - it even needs to work for prolonged periods of offline use. Not only that, when the device gets back online, your app needs to gracefully handle data synchronization and any data conflicts as well.\n\nIn this session, I will share with you hard earned lessons on how to solve the problem of online/offline data resiliency and synchronization using Azure Mobile App Services based on using it in multiple Xamarin projects. You will learn how to solve the issues that arise with improper client-side data schemas, pushing data to the server without knowing when the connection will be interrupted, and reconciling conflicting data between the server and the app. At the end of this session you'll be well equipped to have your app ready for anything.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7463

In talking to team members, I discovered that many people no longer know what the original XP was about.   Still today, successful teams are using some or all of what XP introduced.   If your team is struggling, maybe you are missing an important part of the puzzle.  This talk will be the story of XP and a review of the Values, Principles, and Practices.  We will talk about how the Practices fit together and reinforce each other.

DESCRIPTION:TL\; DR\: You can programmatically edit images in the browser! Stop building 30 versions of the same image, and embrace SVG.\n\nYou’ve probably heard of SVG before, and you’re probably not using it in your everyday web development.\nSVG is a standard that is frequently overlooked—the web community most likely just isn’t familiar enough with SVG for widespread adoption.  This presentation aims to change that!\nThe goal of the presentation is to show you why you should be using SVG, and how to use it. SVG is always responsive. SVG files are significantly smaller and simpler than raster images (jpg, png, gif). SVG allows for extensive animation.\nMost importantly, you can programmatically edit images in the browser! Do you have a green logo that you need to be white in certain places? This use case happens frequently, and is very easy to handle using SVG.\nBy the end of the presentation, you will know more about SVG than 99.999% of the planet. Wow! And knowing is half the battle.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7428

DESCRIPTION:JSON is quickly becoming the de facto data exchange format on the web with more and more web services serving content in JSON format. In fact, with the growing popularity of NoSQL databases, content is even being stored as JSON. The ability to encode JSON to and from native language representations is quickly becoming integral to developing a web or mobile app. In this talk, we look at how we can accomplish this using Swift 4.\n\nSwift 4 was introduced in summer of 2017 and with it came Codables. Swift Codables greatly simplify the process of encoding and decoding from native swift objects to/from other representations , including JSON. Codables does away with the tedious JSON serialization /deserialization logic you probably had in place in earlier versions.  In this talk, we will introduce you to Codables and look at examples of how you can use it for JSON serialization.\n\nAnyone building apps using Swift 4 will benefit from this talk.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6938

DESCRIPTION:CRUD apps destroy data.\n\nDelete is an obviously destructive operation, but Update is no better. Updates overwrite the data that was once present. What would software look like if the only valid operations were Create and Read?\n\nHistorical Modeling is a technique for designing and building software systems that permit only inserts, no updates, no deletes. The only way to "modify" an object is to insert related records. You can then read the state of the object by querying for the presence or absence of those related records. We'll start with the assumption that all records are immutable and indelible. From there, we'll build a set of patterns that yield some surprising benefits.\n\nWith a historical model, synchronizing disparate nodes is trivial\: just insert what you don't yet have. Building offline-first web applications is easy. Viewing a snapshot of the system at any point in the past is a simple query.\n\nLet's build a historical model together, and see these benefits for ourselves. Let's put aside the assumptions of CRUD applications and discover a whole new set of patterns. Once you master these techniques, you will never destroy data again.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7220

DESCRIPTION:Adversity. A necessary component of life. Inevitably, we all reach professional and personal moments that require us to take a deep breath and a giant step back. Moving forward again often feels difficult, even impossible. We suffer, immobilized by fear.\n\nBut fear is more than some pesky roadblock. It is a rational response to adversity. Whether facing a major code refactoring, the changing technology landscape, a new role, or even a fresh career, we can learn to leverage fear and uncertainty to move beyond our hurdles and get the job done! Key life skills exist that can be developed to conquer adversity. Learn to assess risks, build relationships, and recognize opportunities for growth.\n\nStarting over may seem insurmountable. Armed with the right skills, perspective, and a little patience, nothing truly is.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6918

SUMMARY:Testing Layers in a Distributed Architecture
DTSTAMP:20180104T003600Z
DTSTART:20180112T210000Z
DTEND:20180112T220000Z
DESCRIPTION:Modern web applications often rely on internal APIs, multiple frontend applications, several third-party services, and dozens of vendor libraries. With complex distributed systems like this, how can we create a comprehensive test plan that covers everything without slowing development down to a crawl?\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss creating test plans for complex, service-oriented applications as well as some best practices for testing across a distributed architecture. We'll see how layers of unit, integration, acceptance, and end-to-end tests can greatly improve the reliability of our applications and make maintaining them much easier in the long-run.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7231

SUMMARY:ZAPping Security Vulnerabilities in Your Development Pipeline
DTSTAMP:20180104T003600Z
DTSTART:20180112T210000Z
DTEND:20180112T220000Z
DESCRIPTION:When your application has a security vulnerability, will you or an attacker find it first? Reviewing code and tracking down hidden flaws can be tedious and difficult. Let the free and open source OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) help. This session walks through four ways to use ZAP\: UI, command line, scripts, and automated development pipeline. You will learn how to attack a live application in all four ways, how to target specific areas of your application for heavier scrutiny, test for specific vulnerabilities, and incorporate ZAP with your development pipeline to automate the whole process including regression testing and report generation, so that vulnerabilities are discovered the moment they are introduced.\nhttp\://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=7209
